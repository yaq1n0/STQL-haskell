## How to run
1. ```ghc Stql.hs```
2. ```./Stql prN.stql```
3. wait patiently

### Disclaimer
If something went wrong and you've run ```cabal install...``` multiple times, you should delete the ```dist-newstyle``` folder and the ```.ghc.environment...``` files that showed up as a result cause they, most likely, will be incorrect, and run the command again, once.
